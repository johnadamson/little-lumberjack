Little Lumberjack 
=================

A small [Sinatra](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra) app that logs all
incoming HTTP requests for later inspection.  This makes testing
interaction with 3rd party endpoints easy.

In my toolchain, I use this app with [Pow](http://pow.cx/) and
[Chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby).
